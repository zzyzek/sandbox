###### 2026-02-28

* normalize vertex triple return of cocha (ccw rel. face normal)
* add mirror point on boundary for convex hull test
* test $p$ inside/outside convex hull

###### 2026-01-15

nixed, moved onto convex hull algorithm

* Make C/C++ implementation
* Generate $\pi/4 + \epsilon$ data and show still has linear performance
  - or not? figure out how to rotate? How to avoid this scenario?
* Scale to 1M+ points
* Get visualization working
* Get test cases with restricted regions
