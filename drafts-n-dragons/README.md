Drafts and Dragons
===

Attempts at looking into a Dungeons and Diagrams generator and solver.

It looks like brute force solvers work well.
Generation is likely easily as trivial.

I assumed this was a more complicated problem without validation, which
is the reason for all the CBTG attempts.

There might be more to do with analysis of how and when the generation
and solution are over/under constrained, but I'm considering this investigation
complete.
