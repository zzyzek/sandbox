* Is there a polynomial time algorithm to find an $s,t-\text{Hamiltonian}$ path
  in a 2D solid grid graph?
* Is there a polynomial time algorithm to find a $k=2$ zig-zag numberlink solution
  in a 2D rectangle? How about a solid grid graph?
* Is there an expected linear time or near linear time algorithm to find the relative
  neighborhood graph of uniform random 3d points in a cube?
