Collaboration Terms
===

###### 2025-03-20

To help set expectations on collaboration, I have, in general, the
following terms that need to be met.


---

> You may, at any point in the future, remove me as an author.
> In the case that I am no longer an author, the expectation is that you will
> publish without me.


Publishing without giving me authorship can include
using any work that I might have done to help.

Under this condition, I won't contest my removal or make any demands on co-authorship.

---

> Under the condition we publish a paper together, I will not be the primary author.
> Insofar as is possible, I will be the last author.

This is open to negotiation if there are exceptional circumstances.

---

> All work I create will be under a libre/free license.

This includes code, artwork, text or any other digital artifact.
I define a libre/free license as one that allows for alteration,
reuse and copying, including commercial uses.

---

> You have final decision on the contents of the paper and where to publish.

I can offer helpful effort and suggestions but the authoritative decision
on contents and where to pursue publication is yours.

---

> None of the above conditions apply to discoveries made that go beyond the
> scope of the paper or any resulting work that comes from the new discoveries.

---

In exceptional circumstances, this may be altered but the above should be the starting
point for what to expect from a collaboration with me.
