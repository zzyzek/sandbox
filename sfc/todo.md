* make sure hibiscus, peony, milfoil and hellebore curves have subdivision schemes
  that are stable (make a tool to help make this transparent?)
* document hibiscus, peony, milfoil and hellebore
  - figure out better names
  - make diagrams (create general purpose diagram creator?)
* update gilbert-paper issues with all the various curves
* consider adding another subdivision scheme fore milfoil that splits it in 3


###### 2025-06-05

* ~generalized Moore curve~ ( ~2d~ ,3d, `Hellebore`?, `Milfoil`, `Moosewood`?)
  - mostly done except for the 111 (notch) case, don't know how to make it stable
    with the subdivision scheme for 000, 100/010/001, 011/101/110
  - done, hellebore
* ~convert all Peony, Guiseppe to Hibiscus~
* ~rename Guiseppe to something? (`Peanut`, `Pear`, `Poplar`)~
