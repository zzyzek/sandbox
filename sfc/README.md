Space Filling Curves

Peano-like Curves
---

The 3x3 base point template, that starts in the lower left and ends in the upper right,
has some two choices in how the 'S-curve' is oriented (right to start or up to start).

This gives a base $2^9 = 512$ raw number of distinct curves.
Apparently, $2^4 \cdot 2 = 32$ are palindromes and the remaining $512 - 32 = 480$
have central symmetry, yielding only $272$ distinct Peaon-like curves.
