* need validation script to confirm curve is valid

###### 2025-04-10

* `gilbert3d_case` figure should have shadow blocks to highlight that the sub cuboids
  sits within the larger block
  - nixed, too busy
* `gilbert3d_case` should have start/end markers for the base block
  - done
* `gilbert3d_case` should have alpha/beta/gamma on the base block
  - put this in legend at top
  - maybe next to 'block axis' with mini axis under each Jsplit
